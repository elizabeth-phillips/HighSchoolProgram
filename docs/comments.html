<h1 id="comments">Comments</h1>
<h2 id="singlelinecomments">Single-line Comments</h2>
<p>In order to make comments that describe our programs but are not run as code, we can use the <code>#</code> symbol before any line we'd like the program to ignore.</p>
<p>For example, let's put some comments in our "Hello world" program like so:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python"># This is my first python program
print("Hello world!")
# This is the end of my new Python program.
</code></pre>
<p>In order for all Python programmers' comments to be uniform and readable, you may get certain errors regarding the formatting of comments.</p>
<p>Comments should be formatted with one space after the <code>#</code> symbol, and the first letter of the comment should be capitalized. Just like the example above.</p>
<p>If you want to make multiple single line comments, you can highlight the section of code that you would like to comment and press <code>command</code> + <code>/</code>.</p>
<h2 id="multilinecomments">Multi-line Comments</h2>
<p>If you'd like to write more than one line in comments, use the <code>'''</code> character to surround the text as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">'''
This is an example of a multi-line
comment in python. If you have a lot
to say about how the program runs
you can put a block of comments like so!
'''
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish, you can also use double-quotes for your multi-line comments:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">"""
This is an example of a multi-line
comment in python. If you have a lot
to say about how the program runs
you can put a block of comments like so!
"""
</code></pre>
<p>The triple double-quotes are meant for <strong>docstrings</strong>. Python documentation strings (or <code>docstrings</code>) provide a convenient way of adding documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. <code>docstring</code> describes what the code does, not how.</p>
<p>From now on, place the following at the top of your files:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">"""
title: file_name
author: your_name
date: current_date
"""
</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to create a template that will create a header whenever a new Python file.</p>
<p><code>PyCharm</code> > <code>Preferences</code> > <code>Editor</code> > <code>File and Code Templates</code> > <code>Python Script</code>.</p>
<p>Type the following in the text box.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">"""
title: ${NAME}
author: ${USER}
date: ${DATE} ${TIME}
"""
</code></pre>
<p>When creating functions, docstrings allow for a developer to describe the details of the function. The format of the docstring is autogenerated by many IDEs. An example of the pep 257 style guide for docstrings is:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">def greeting(name, year):
    """
    Greet the user with a friendly hello and inform them of the year
    :param name: a string that stores the users name
    :param year: an integer that stores the current year
    :return: the concatenated string
    """
    return "Hello from the other side," + name + "! It is " + str(year)
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to see the docstring from the <code>greeting</code> example from above, we would do:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">help(greeting)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>greeting(name, year)
    Greet the user with a friendly hello and inform them of the year
    :param name: a string that stores the users name
    :param year: an integer that stores the current year
    :return: the concatenated string
</code></pre>
