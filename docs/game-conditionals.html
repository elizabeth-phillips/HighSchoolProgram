<h1> Adding conditionals to the game!</h1>
<p>We left off getting the user's x,y coordinates of where the player clicked.  We're going to use our new found knowledge of conditionals to figure out if the user clicked on a row, column, or in some other random space.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
    def handle_click(e):
        print("someone clicked", e.x, e.y)
</code></pre>

<h2>Add Logical Grid Position</h2>
<p>We're going to start by transforming the x,y coordinates to a logical position on our grid. <br>
Let's create a function that will accept x,y coordinates and return two value: 
<ul>
    <li>Did the click occur on a line?  Boolean</li>
    <li>Was it a row or a column? String</li>
    <li>Where in the grid did the player click? Numberical Grid Position</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Create a function called get_logical_position and pass the x,y coordinates to it. <br>
In order to get the logical position, we first need to change our coordinates into an array,<br>
To do this, we'll need to import <code>numpy</code>at the top.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
import numpy as np
# .... 
def get_logical_position(x, y):
  grid_position = np.array([x, y])
  print(grid_position)

def handle_click(e):
  get_logical_position(e.x, e.y)
</code></pre>

<h3>Get logical position</h3>
<p>Next, we'll use the following formula to determine the relative position: </p>
<p>Add the following to the <code>get_logical_position</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
    pos = (grid_position - distance_between_dots/4) // (distance_between_dots/2)
    type = False
        logical_position = []
        if position[1] % 2 == 0 and (position[0] - 1) % 2 == 0:
            r = int((position[0]-1)//2)
            c = int(position[1]//2)
            logical_position = [r, c]
            type = 'row'
            # self.row_status[c][r]=1
        elif position[0] % 2 == 0 and (position[1] - 1) % 2 == 0:
            c = int((position[1] - 1) // 2)
            r = int(position[0] // 2)
            logical_position = [r, c]
            type = 'col'

        return logical_position, type
</code></pre>
<p> Add a print after invoking this function, click around the game and see if its accurate. </p>

<h2>Mark the board</h2>
<p>Before we can mark the board, we need to determine which players turn it is!<br>
We also need to start keeping track of which lines are marked by whom, we'll start tracking the status of who's turn it is, and the status of the board.</p>
