<h1>Adding functions to our game!</h1>
<p>Move your drawing of the grid and dots into a function and call it below the definition of the function. 
    <br>
    Name your function draw_board. 
    <br>
    Remember you can just use global variable in a python function! 
    <br>
    Be sure to pass canvas to this function, and use 'c' as the parameter to this function.

<h2>Listening for click event</h2>
<p>Next we're going to add some code so the board will click for user click events. </p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
    window.bind('<Button-1>', handle_click)
</code></pre>
<p>Then define a function named handle_click. In the body of the function add "I've been clicked".  Now when you run the game and click on the board, it should read "I've been clicked" in the console.</p>
<p>Pass the event to the function, so we'll be able to grab the x,y coordinates of the click.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
def handle_click(e):
    print("someone clicked", e.x, e.y)


# ... 
draw_board(canvas)
window.bind("<Button-1>", handle_click)
</code></pre>
