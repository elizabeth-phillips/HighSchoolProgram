<h1>Game Variables</h1>
<p>Create a new Python Repl.it to hold your `dots and lines` game and save it to a new repo on your github org</p>

<h3>Add the following to your `main.py` file:</h3>
<code class="python language-python">
    size_of_board = 600
    number_of_dots = 6
    symbol_size = (size_of_board / 3 - size_of_board / 8) / 2
    symbol_thickness = 50
    dot_color = '#7BC043'
    player1_color = '#0492CF'
    player1_color_light = '#67B0CF'
    player2_color = '#EE4035'
    player2_color_light = '#EE7E77'
    Green_color = '#7BC043'
</code>
<p>Add the following variables: </p>
<ul>
    <li>`dot_width` set equal to 25% times the size of the board divided by the number of dots.</li>
    <li>`edge_width` set equal to 10% times the size of the board divided by the number of dots.</li>
    <li>`distance_between_dots` set equal to the size of the board divided by the number of dots.</li>
</ul>
