<h2 id="pullpushpractice">Pull Push Practice</h2>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pair up into groups of two or three.</li>
<li>Partner #1 create a directory and a public repository called <code>Ping-Pong-Text</code>.</li>
<li>In Partner #1's local copy, create a single text document called <code>my-message.txt</code>. Inside Partner #1's new file, place a single line of whatever text you want. (Maybe Aggie War Hymn words??)</li>
<li>Partner #1 will push this up to their repository.</li>
<li>Partner #2 (and #3 if a group of three) will clone this repository.</li>
<li>Partner #2 creates a branch <code>text-addendum</code> and pushes to <strong>GitHub</strong>.</li>
<li>If you are a group of three, the Partner #3 makes a branch <code>third-addendum</code> and pushes to <strong>GitHub</strong>.</li>
<li>Partner #2 (and #3 if a group of three) will add a single line of whatever text they want to the text file. Stage the changes, commits, and then pushes the change to GitHub.</li>
<li>Partner #1 pulls change, edits next line, stages, commits, and pushes.</li>
<li>Keep going and get as many lines filled within the time limit.</li>
</ul>
