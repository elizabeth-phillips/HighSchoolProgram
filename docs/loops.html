<h1 id="loops">Loops</h1>
<p>From what we have learned so far, to print all of the values from a list called numbers we would have to do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">numbers = [10, 5, 2, 7]
print(numbers[0])
print(numbers[1])
print(numbers[2])
print(numbers[3])
</code></pre>
<p>That is a lot of lines! We should not ever have to repeat the same action over and over again. This is where loops come in to play.</p>
<h2 id="forloops">For loops</h2>
<p>For loops are used to repeat the same action a known number of times. A for loop can help with printing out all the values of any <strong>iterable</strong>.
An iterable is an item that is capable of returning its members one at a time, such as a list, tuple, or string. Indentation is very important!
Indentation tells the Python interpreter what belongs together. In the loops case, it tells the Python Interpreter which line(s) to repeat.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Set Up</h3>
<p>In Python, for loops are constructed like so:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">for [iterating variable] in [iterable]:
  [do something]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>iterating variable</strong> : the temporary name of the current element. This can be called any valid variable. It's best practice not to name this the same name as another existing variable.</p>
<p><strong>iterable</strong> : the iterable that you are looping through it's elements</p>
<p><strong>do something</strong> : any action that you are wanting to repeat</p>
<p>Example 1: For loop going through a list, printing each item on the same line</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">for i in [10, 5, 2, 7]:
  print(i, end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>10 5 2 7</code></p>
<p><code>i</code> represents the iterating variable and holds the value of the element that is currently being used. It will be assigned to each element in turn for each <strong>iteration</strong> through the loop.
An iteration is what number time you have repeated the action in the loop.</p>
<p>Reminder: <code>end = " "</code> prints all of the numbers on the <strong>same line</strong> with a space in between.</p>
<p>Example 2: For loop printing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 each on the same line</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
  print(x, end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>1 2 3 4</code></p>
<p>Example 3: For loop going through a list called numbers, printing each item on the same line</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">numbers = [20, 30, 40, 50]
for k in numbers:
  print(k, end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>20 30 40 50</code></p>
<p>Example 4: For loop going through a string called name, printing each character on the same line</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">name = "Betty"
for w in name:
  print(w, end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>B e t t y</code></p>
<p>Example 2 leads to a need for a new function because counting from one number to the next is a very common need in development. What if you wanted to print out the numbers 1 through 100?
If we did it the way shown above, you would have to physically type 100 numbers and commas! This is where range can help us out.</p>
<h3 id="range">Range</h3>
<p>Range is a handy function that creates lists in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>range([start,] stop [,step])
</code></pre>
<p>The above square brackets, in this case, are used to mean "This is optional". When both step and stop are not specified, the list will start at 0, step by 1's, and go up to but not including stop.
When start and stop are specified, the list starts at start, goes up by 1's, and up to but not including stop.
When all three values are specified, the list will start at start, go up by step, and go up to but not including stop. Below are some examples showing different uses for range.</p>
<p>Example 1: Using just stop</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">range(4)
</code></pre>
<p>The list generated above would be <code>[0, 1, 2, 3]</code></p>
<p>Example 2: Using just start and stop</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">range(1, 4)
</code></pre>
<p>The list generated above would be <code>[1, 2, 3]</code></p>
<p>Example 3: Using start, stop, and step</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">range(1, 10, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>The list generated above would be <code>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</code></p>
<p><strong>For Loops with Range</strong></p>
<p>If we combine the two concepts of for loops and range together, we can do things way more efficiently!</p>
<p>Example 1: For loops using Range</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">for i in range(2, 10, 3):
  print(i, end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>2 5 8</code></p>
<p>Example 2: For loops using Range as a counter</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python"># Say you wanted to repeat the word "OM" 5 times
for i in range(5):
  print("OM", end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>OM OM OM OM OM</code></p>
<h3 id="forloopsusingoperations">For Loops using Operations</h3>
<p>There is often a need for the same operation to be done on or with every item in a list or tuple. For loops allow you to this:</p>
<p>Example 1: Squaring every element in a list</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">prices = [12, 7, 9, 10]
for i in prices:
  print(i ** 2, end = " ")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>144 49 81 100</code></p>
<p>Example 2: Finding the total of a list</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">prices = [12, 7, 9, 10]
total = 0
for i in prices:
  total += i
print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>38</code></p>
<p>Example 2 is a little different than what we have seen before. Every iteration, we added on the current element in the list to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first iteration added the first item (12) in the list to total, change total's value to 12.</p></li>
<li><p>The second iteration added the second item (7) in the list to total, change total's value to 19.</p></li>
<li><p>The third iteration added the third item (9) in the list to total, change total's value to 28.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth and final iteration added the fourth item (10) in the list to total, change total's value to 38.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enumerate"><code>enumerate</code></h3>
<p>So far, we have just wanted to either loop through a list OR use range to count. <code>enumerate</code> adds a counter to an iterable and returns it.</p>
<p><strong>enumerate Set Up</strong></p>
<pre><code>enumerate(iterable, start=0)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>iterable:</strong> a sequence, an iterator, or objects that supports iteration  </li>
<li><strong>start:</strong> (optional) starts counting from this number. If start is not provided, the count will start at 0.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>enumerate Examples</strong></p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">grocery = ['bread', 'milk', 'butter']

for item in enumerate(grocery):
  print(item)

print('\n')
for count, item in enumerate(grocery):
  print(count, item)

for count, item in enumerate(grocery, 100):
  print(count, item)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>(0, 'bread')
(1, 'milk')
(2, 'butter')

0 bread
1 milk
2 butter

100 bread
101 milk
102 butter
</code></pre>

<h2 id="whileloops">While Loops</h2>
<p>While Loops are used when the same task needs to happen until a condition is met. The code that is in a <code>while</code> block will execute as long as the <code>while</code> statement evaluates to True.
For example, when a user is typing in their password the login screen will remain up until the user types in the correct password. Who knows how many times they might type it in wrong!
As opposed to for loops that execute a certain number of times, while loops are conditionally base, so you don't need to know how many times to repeat the code going in.</p>
<h3 id="setup-1">Set Up</h3>
<p>In Python, while loops are constructed like so:</p>
<pre><code>while [a condition is True]:
  [do something]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>a condition is True</strong> : a boolean statement that determines if you go into the loop or not.</p>
<p><strong>do something</strong> : any action that you are wanting to repeat</p>
<p>Example 1: While loop that repeats until the temperature of tea is at 112</p>
<pre><code>temperature = 115
while (temperature &gt; 112):
  print(temperature, end = "-")
  temperature -= 1
print('The tea is cool enough')
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>115-114-113-The tea is cool enough</code></p>
<p>Example 2: While Loop that repeats the phrase "Waiting" until a user presses the x key</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">x_input = input("Enter the x key: ")
while (x_input != "x"):
  print("Waiting")
  x_input = input("Enter the x key: ")
print("Thank you for typing x!")
</code></pre>
<p>The output of Example 2 varies depending on that the user types in. Two example outputs are show below:</p>
<p>Example 2 Output 1: User types in two incorrect inputs before typing in x.</p>
<pre><code>Enter the x key: hi
Waiting
Enter the x key: y
Waiting
Enter the x key: x
Thank you for typing x!
</code></pre>
<p>Example 2 Output 2: User types in x the first loop.</p>
<pre><code>Enter the x key: x
Thank you for typing x!
</code></pre>
<h3 id="commonmistakes">Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>Be VERY careful about infinite loops! This occurs when your condition would never return False. Two examples of this are shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">while True:
  print("Ah!")

while 5 == 5:
  print("Forever looping!")
</code></pre>
<p>Both of these loops would go on forever!</p>
<h3 id="applyingyourknowledge-1">Applying your knowledge</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a <code>while</code> loop that will count down from 10 to 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Asks the user to enter an integer that is greater than 0. The function will keep on asking the user for the number until it is valid.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the user to enter two separate integers (The first number must be smaller than the second). Create a while loop that will count from the first number to the second.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the user to respond by 'Y', 'y', 'yes', 'YES' or 'N', 'n', 'no', 'NO'. The function keeps on asking until the user enters the correct information.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="errorhandlingwithawhileloopexercise">Error handling with a while loop exercise</h3>
<p>Given this <code>while</code> loop, write a try/except statement. The input of the users guess can only be a whole number. Make sure the <code>except</code> throws an error (One exception total) for both floating point numbers and letters.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">count = 0
while count &lt; 5:
    guess = int(input("Take a guess "))
    count = count + 1
</code></pre>
