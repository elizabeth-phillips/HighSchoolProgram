<h1>TKINTER</h1>

<quote>The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)</quote>
<p>per the python documentation which can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">here</a>.</p>


<p>Tkinter allows us to easily inteface with the GUI.  </p>
<note>GUI stands for Graphical User Interface</note>
