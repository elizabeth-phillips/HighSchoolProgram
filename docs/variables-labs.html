<p><strong>Can a swallow carry a coconut?</strong></p>
<p>This Monty Python-inspired math problem</p>
<p>Assuming a swallow weighs 60 grams, and one swallow is capable of carrying 1/3 of its own weight…​ Can a swallow carry a coconut, average weight being 1450 grams?</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Write the equation to determine how many grams total a single swallow is capable of carrying, include the answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the equation to determine how many swallows it will take to carry a coconut weighing 1450 grams.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the above equation in a single line, instead of two separate steps, and include the answer.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>What other fruit can a swallow carry?</strong></p>
<p>Swallows per coconut: <code>1450 / (60 / 3) = 72.5</code></p>
<p>Swallows per apple: <code>128 / (60 / 3) = 6.4</code></p>
<p>Swallows per cherry: <code>8 / (60 / 3) = 0.4</code></p>
<p>After all of our intensive calculations, we've finally found that a single swallow has the ability to carry a cherry!</p>
<p>If we look at our equations, we can see a lot of <strong>repetition</strong>. One thing programmers hate is repeating their code over and over so they use a handy-dandy thing called a <strong>variable</strong> to make equations (and code) easier to read and write. Which part of the three above equations is being repeated?</p>

<p><strong>Can a macaw carry a coconut?</strong></p>
<p>Using IDLE, declare a variable for each value and find out the macaw's carrying limit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The percentage of the weight they can carry (Given value: 1/3)</li>
<li>The coconuts weight (Given value: 1450)</li>
<li>The macaw's weight (Given value: 900)</li>
<li>Variable for number of macaws required</li>
<li>Print the number of macaws required to carry a coconut
Click to Reveal Answer</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Ultimately, we need 4.8 macaws to carry a coconut. This gives us a more difficult issue, since we can't summon 0.8 of a bird, so we'd like to be able to round that number up for a more reasonable answer we can actually work with.</p>
<h2 id="usingpycharmtowriteourfirstprogram">Using PyCharm to write our first program</h2>
<p>Python has many modules at our disposal which can a make more difficult math problems seem like a breeze. In order to use <strong>any</strong> module in Python, we <code>import</code> it like so:</p>
<pre><code>import math
</code></pre>
<p>Open the project <code>python-foundations</code>, then right-click it again and go to New → Python File and enter <code>math_variables</code> as the file name. PyCharm will automatically add the <code>.py</code> for this file.</p>
<p>Type <code>import math</code> on the first line of the file. We can look at the math module documentation to on check which function we want to use for our specific problem: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/math.html">Python Math Library Documentation</a></p>
<p>You don't have to scroll down very far on the page to see that the math library offers a <code>math.ceil()</code> function which will return the smallest number greater than or equal to the value you put inside the parenthesis.</p>
<p>Let's try it! In your PyCharm, type out and run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">import math
num_macaws = 4.8
math.ceil(num_macaws)
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the program runs, but it's not giving us any output. In order to actually <strong>see</strong> our result, we have to use a function we haven't introduced yet: the <code>print()</code> function. Re-run the program but put <code>math.ceil(num_macaws)</code> inside a <code>print()</code> function, and view the output.</p>
<p>Our entire <code>macaw</code> program looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">import math
carrying_weight_percentage = 1/3
coconut_weight = 1450
macaw_weight = 900
macaw_limit = macaw_weight * carrying_weight_percentage
number_macaws = coconut_weight/macaw_limit
print(math.ceil(number_macaws))
</code></pre>
