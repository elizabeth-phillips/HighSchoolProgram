## Pull Push Practice

**Directions**


- Pair up into groups of two or three.
- Partner #1 create a directory and a public repository called `Ping-Pong-Text`.
- In Partner #1's local copy, create a single text document called `my-message.txt`. Inside Partner #1's new file, place a single line of whatever text you want. (Maybe Aggie War Hymn words??)
- Partner #1 will push this up to their repository.
- Partner #2 (and #3 if a group of three) will clone this repository.
- Partner #2 creates a branch `text-addendum` and pushes to **GitHub**.
  - If you are a group of three, the Partner #3 makes a branch `third-addendum` and pushes to **GitHub**.
- Partner #2 (and #3 if a group of three) will add a single line of whatever text they want to the text file. Stage the changes, commits, and then pushes the change to GitHub.
- Partner #1 pulls change, edits next line, stages, commits, and pushes.
- Keep going and get as many lines filled within the time limit.
