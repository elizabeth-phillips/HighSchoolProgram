## ASCII Art

ASCII Art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from characters. An example ASCII art is:
```
                   |  |
|-|_____-----/   |_|  |_|   \-----_____|-|
|_|_________{   }|  (^) |{  }__________|_|
 ||          |_| |   ^  | |_|          ||
 |              \|  /\  |/              |
 |               \ |--| /               |
 =               \ |__| /               =
 +               \      /               +
                  \    /
                  \    /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                    \/
```
Using this idea and print statements, create a smiley face or the first letter of your first name.
