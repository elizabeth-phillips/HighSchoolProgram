# Comments

## Single-line Comments

In order to make comments that describe our programs but are not run as code, we can use the `#` symbol before any line we'd like the program to ignore.

For example, let's put some comments in our "Hello world" program like so:
```python
# This is my first python program
print("Hello world!")
# This is the end of my new Python program.
```
In order for all Python programmers' comments to be uniform and readable, you may get certain errors regarding the formatting of comments.

Comments should be formatted with one space after the `#` symbol, and the first letter of the comment should be capitalized. Just like the example above.

If you want to make multiple single line comments, you can highlight the section of code that you would like to comment and press `command` \+ `/`.

## Multi-line Comments

If you'd like to write more than one line in comments, use the `'''` character to surround the text as follows:
```python
'''
This is an example of a multi-line
comment in python. If you have a lot
to say about how the program runs
you can put a block of comments like so!
'''
```
If you wish, you can also use double-quotes for your multi-line comments:
```python
"""
This is an example of a multi-line
comment in python. If you have a lot
to say about how the program runs
you can put a block of comments like so!
"""
```
The triple double-quotes are meant for **docstrings**. Python documentation strings (or `docstrings`) provide a convenient way of adding documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. `docstring` describes what the code does, not how.

From now on, place the following at the top of your files:
```python
"""
title: file_name
author: your_name
date: current_date
"""
```


When creating functions, docstrings allow for a developer to describe the details of the function. The format of the docstring is autogenerated by many IDEs. An example of the pep 257 style guide for docstrings is:
```python
def greeting(name, year):
    """
    Greet the user with a friendly hello and inform them of the year
    :param name: a string that stores the users name
    :param year: an integer that stores the current year
    :return: the concatenated string
    """
    return "Hello from the other side," + name + "! It is " + str(year)
```
If we wanted to see the docstring from the `greeting` example from above, we would do:
```python
help(greeting)
```
Output:
```
greeting(name, year)
    Greet the user with a friendly hello and inform them of the year
    :param name: a string that stores the users name
    :param year: an integer that stores the current year
    :return: the concatenated string
```
