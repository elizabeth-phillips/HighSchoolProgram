# PyCharm

For the majority of this course we'll be using PyCharm. PyCharm was created specifically for Python development much like IDLE and it has some nice features. Python tends to be very opinionated around indentation and other syntax, and PyCharm will raise these errors for us before we even run the program! This helps with creating good habits around writing Python right off the bat.

# Getting Started

We installed Python3 onto every iMac for this class. For your personal computer, youâ€™ll want to visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the newest version of Python.

PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. Here at Home Depot, we have a dedicated license to use PyCharm Professional, Community and Edu versions. Just download the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/) and you can have PyCharm and more on your own machine.
