## ASCII Art

ASCII Art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from characters. An example ASCII art is:
```
__  | |
|-|_____-----/   |_|  |_|   \-----_____|-|
|_|_________{   }|  (^) |{  }__________|_|
 ||          |_| |   ^  | |_|          ||
 |              \|  /\  |/              |
 |               \ |--| /               |
 =               \ |__| /               =
 +               \      /               +
                  \    /
                  \    /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                   \  /
                    \/
```
Using this idea and print statements, create a smiley face or the first letter of your first name.

## Random Salary

Create a program that will give a user a raise on their current salary.

- Ask a user to input their name as a string and store it to variable `name` 
- Ask a user to input their salary **as an int** and store it in variable `salary` 
- Create a variable called `raise_per` that is set to a **random** integer value between 0 and 100. (Hint: Review the random method) 
- Create a variable called `raise_amount` that is equal to the inputted `salary`**plus** the added random percentage from the previous step.
    

Using Python3 Formatting, print out the person's name and salary in the following format:
```
Enter your name: Helga
>>> Enter your salary: 15000
Helga, your current salary is $15000.
Your raise is 15% of $15000.
Helga, your new salary is $17250.
```
