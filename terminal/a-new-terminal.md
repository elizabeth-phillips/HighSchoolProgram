# Episode 5: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

## Terminal Commands Practice

Place your hands on your keyboard, and let the Force flow through your finger tips. No touching your mousepad!

1. Open the **Terminal app** (use Spotlight)
2. Make sure you are in your home directory.
3. Create the directory `~/orange-method-firstname`
4. Change your current directory to `~/orange-method-firstname`

    ```
    terror!
    Terror!
